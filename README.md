# Kravanenn

This is a Rust package providing a few tools for Coq. Most notably, there is currently:

- A library that reimplements OCaml native serialization from the `Marshal` module in pure Rust.
- A implementation of the Hopcroft algorithm tailored for the reduction of OCaml structures. See [this OCaml implementation](https://github.com/ppedrot/ocaml-compactor) for more details.
- Stubs for browsing Coq `vo` object files
